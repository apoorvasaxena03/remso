%  The QP problem considered by prsqpStep does not consider all
%  constraints. Therefore it is necessary to map the considered constraints
%  slacks and dual variables to the corresponding vector considering all
%  variables
%
%
%  This is helper function for this purpose.
%
%  vals - Values obtained during the QP process
%  activeVars - boolean vector of the dimension of the variables, with true
%               in all position considered within vals
%  nv - number of variables per cell block in vals.
